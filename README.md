## About the Video Course
This course introduces Python users to Selenium WebDriver. It will help users with basic programming knowledge to start code-testing. This course will help users cut down on their time spent on testing code written in Python. 
Get started with code testing using Selenium WebDriver. This course is an ideal starter kit for those of you who wish to start using Selenium WebDriver for testing, and for users with basic programming knowledge who are more interested in skilling up with Selenium WebDriver as their testing tool of choice. In this course, you will start by learning the benefits of Selenium WebDriver for testing. You will then start practicing the basics. Next, you will explore the biggest strength of Selenium: integrating your test instances with the browser of your choice. You will then actually test an authentication system in a sequential manner by following each of the required steps.
